# The Story of Australia

This final project is a joint collaboration between Stephen Guilmartin and Arvin Seeva. The title of the project is Australia At A Glance. 

## The Website

The website is an expansion of the previous project which focused on the population and the economy. In this version, the focus will be on tourism, sports and well-being. 


## The team

The team is made of two key value pairs, Stephen and Arvin. Stephen will focus on deploying the website on the cloud. This choice of services is yet to be defined at the time of writing. Stephen will also be looking to visually narrate the sporting trends and culture. 

Arvin will be taking the lead on machine learning and neural networks. He will assess the reviews available from AirBNB on Perth, Melbourne and Sydney to make recommendations for local holidaymakers. Arvin will also be responsible to document the journey.
